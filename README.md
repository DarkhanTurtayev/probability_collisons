# probability_collisons
Small experimental programs for calculating number of tryout when two random dots appear at the same place

Intresting that its more likely of two random points to collide when they appear in the same time, rather than one point is generated and the other one tries to appear on the same position (check fucntions shoot() and absolute_random())

Visual representation using Matplotlib appears to be very slow for point out of 10 range
